Brief
----

Our first project, to create a ruby script that would allow a user to create or amend a csv file containing information about students. Information is added by the user via the STDIN (ruby gets method) and then saved into a CSV file. Prompts were formatted in a way that they were centered to current size of the terminal.

Tech
----

Ruby
Command Line
Git

Outcome
----

This was an exercise in basic ruby functionality - we did not yet have any knowledge of TDD or OOP, so there are no classes and no tests. A lot of the methods do not adhere to SRT. We had been coding for less than a week.
